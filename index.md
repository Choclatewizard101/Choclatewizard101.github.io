### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

   Lab 5 was one of my favorite labs because It introduced the practical application of the RectangleArea function in calculating the area of a rectangle. Lab 5, part 2, stood out as a favorite due to its approach to addressing real-world challenges in unit conversions, precision handling, and error-checking, all within the context of modular C++ programming.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was another one of my favorites because the code introduces the use of vectors in C++ to store and manage command-line arguments, which provided me with more hands-on experience with fundamental data structures. I was also able to output error messages for incorrect input showcases, making it very user-friendly.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 is a favorite of mine because it combines practical command-line argument handling with the implementation of a date difference calculation using the Julian Day algorithm. This lab emphasizes the importance of breaking down a problem into smaller functions, promoting code modularity. I learned to convert command-line arguments to integers using std::stoi() and to implement the Fliegel & Van Flandern algorithm to calculate the Julian Day.
